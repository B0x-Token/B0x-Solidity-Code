// 100% of 0xBitcoin accepted for B0x Tokens
// 100% Of the Token is distributed to the users! No dev fee!
// Token Mining will take place on Base Blockchain, while having the token reside on Mainnet Ethereum for maximum security.

// Total supply: 31,165,100.000000000000000000
//   =
// 10,835,900 0xBitcoin Tokens able to transfered to B0x Tokens.
// +
// 10,164,100 Mined over 100+ years using Bitcoins Distrubtion halvings every ~4 years. Uses Proof-oF-Work to distribute the tokens. Public Miner is available see https://bzerox.com/

// 10,164,100 sent to Liquidity Providers of the 0xBTC/B0x liquidity pool. Distributes 1 token to the Staking contract for every 1 token minted by Proof-of-Work miners

//
// No dev cut, or advantage taken at launch. Public miner available at launch. 100% of the token is given away fairly over 100+ years using Bitcoins model!

// Mint 2016 answers per challenge in this cost savings Bitcoin!! Less failed transactions as the challenge only changes every 2016 answers instead of every answer.
